# Tesnor-Flow-SC-Fertilizer-and-Crop-Recommendation-system
GeziraPal is an agriculture and crop cultivation assistance project aimed at sharing knowledge among individuals. Leveraging TensorFlow, a renowned machine learning framework, the project implements a recommendation system deployed via Streamlit. This system suggests suitable crops to cultivate based on a variety of factors, aiding users in making informed decisions about their agricultural practices.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Recommendation System: GeziraPal incorporates a sophisticated recommendation system powered by TensorFlow. This system analyzes input parameters provided by users, such as district, soil color, nutrient levels, and environmental factors, to predict and recommend appropriate crops for cultivation.

Streamlit Web Application:
The recommendation system is deployed as a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the tool easily. Users can input their specific parameters through the web interface and receive real-time recommendations.

Two Recommendation Modes:
GeziraPal offers two recommendation modes to cater to different user preferences. The Basic Recommender allows users to input basic parameters like district, fertilizer, and soil color, while the AI Recommender provides more advanced prediction capabilities based on additional factors such as nutrient levels and weather conditions.

YouTube Tutorial Recommendations: In addition to crop recommendations, GeziraPal provides users with links to related YouTube tutorials, enabling them to learn more about cultivation practices and techniques associated with the recommended crops.
